type nano inside nano?

## The Overkill Way
Quit using computers altogether because clearly Nano is not for real hackers.

## The Desperate Way
Close the terminal window. Easy peasy!

## The Physical Way
Unplug your computer.

## The Noob Way
Switch to Vim and then try to figure out how to exit that instead (good luck!).

## The DeLorean Deception Way
Dave Kennedy (@hackingdave) takes his DeLorean up to 88 mph and travels back in time to disrupt the vim movement. All future versions of Linux will only be distrubted with nano. You're all now one of us!
**__Edited with the greatest terminal text editor in existance and your new benevolant overlord KING NANO!!!!__**

```bash

# Write file
ctrl + o

ctrl + never

```
