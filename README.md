type nano inside nano?   
now unplug the charger?    
and use hammer 😬   

## The Collaborative Way
1. Install JDK, JRE, JVM, Maven, Gradle, and IntelliJ IDEA (use Community Edition if you don't have a license). ☕
2. Make sure you installed Java instead of NodeJS. ⚠️
3. Add the dependency [Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) with a version that has the [Log4shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Log4Shell_logo.png) feature enabled. 📦
4. Start your Log4shell. 🐚
5. Wait until a seasoned hacker connects because the person definitely knows how to exit Nano. 🧑‍💻
6. Be friends with the person. 🫂
7. Ask the person to exit Nano for you. ✔️

## The Overkill Way
Quit using computers altogether because clearly Nano is not for real hackers.

## The Desperate Way
Close the terminal window. Easy peasy!

## The Physical Way
Unplug your computer.

## The Noob Way
Switch to Vim and then try to figure out how to exit that instead (good luck!).
